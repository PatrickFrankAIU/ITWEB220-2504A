For students in ITWEB-220, Term 2503B. 
Patrick Frank, Instructor

**Instructions:** 
- Accept the collaborator invite (check your email) 
- Clone this repository to your local computer
- Add some text to the readme file that's located in the folder with your name on it
- Commit and sync the changes
- Advise the instructor that you're finished
- Note: These steps are also listed in the first Issue, titled "Join and Clone (Do This First)" (all the way at the bottom of the issue list)

**Tips:**
- Avoid changing anything in another student's folder -- this makes it harder for them to get feedback from the instructor
- Please **DO NOT** mark the issue "complete" -- this makes it impossible for other students to see the issue

**Procedure:**
- For each issue that you work on, create a separate folder *within* the folder with our name on it 
- Name this new folder after the Issue's Title 
- Then create an index.html and main.js file within each of these folders, demonstrating the solution to the Issue 
- Please **DO NOT** mark the issue "complete" -- this makes it impossible for other students to see the issue
